STM32Cube HAL and Nucleo-L073RZ: debugging and unit testing

This repository contains files for getting started with the STM32L0 development with STM32Cube using the PlatformIO ecosystem. 

For getting started you can follow the [PlatformIO guide for getting started with debugging and unit testing for STM32F4](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/tutorials/ststm32/stm32cube_debugging_unit_testing.html) but instead of their source code use one in the repo so everything compiles as it should. 

Happy coding.
